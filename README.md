Socila Spec

Social spec is a personality test website created by Eze Onyedikachi in 2024. The website engages users with quesions that gets them to paint mental pictures and share the details of their thoughts with the program. Which in turn takes those details and processes them to give what may be a reflection of the users personality - from their own thoughts.

The codebase uses javascript logic to look through a list of the answers provided by the user and puts out results that match the users selection.
